# The Zen of Vibe Coding

*Beautiful is better than ugly, but runnable is better than beautiful.*  
*Explicit is better than implicit, but verified is better than explicit.*  
*Simple is better than complex, but correct is better than simple.*  
*Complex is better than complicated, but proven is better than complex.*  

**The Core Principles:**

1. **Duplication is good. Dependency is disaster.**
2. **All unverified code is pseudocode.**
3. **If the documentation feels weird, the code must be wrong.**
4. **Trust the types, but verify the proofs.**
5. **Haskell is the bridge between Coq and Python - use it wisely.**
6. **Prove code with symbolic execution, prove design with Coq.**
7. **Tests are cheap, but manual verification is priceless.**
8. **A script becomes a project when AI cannot fix it greedily.**
9. **The internet is a distraction - code locally, think globally.**
10. **Your AI lives in a terminal, but your terminal should be everywhere.**

**The Workflow Zen:**

11. **Write prompts like you write code: precise, composable, debuggable.**
12. **Every AI output is a hypothesis until proven by execution.**
13. **Type errors are conversations, not failures.**
14. **Let the AI write the boring parts; you write the proofs.**
15. **Refactor prompts, not just code.**
16. **The best documentation is a working type system.**
17. **Make invalid states unrepresentable, then ask AI to represent them.**
18. **Your IDE is your first AI - extend it fearlessly.**
19. **Jupyter is for exploration, terminals are for production.**
20. **Rebuild your tools while using them - live in your own reality distortion field.**

**The Verification Mindset:**

21. **If it compiles in Haskell and passes Coq, it's probably correct.**
22. **If it runs in Python and makes sense, it's probably useful.**
23. **Symbolic execution finds the bugs you didn't know to look for.**
24. **SMT solvers are your silent partners in verification.**
25. **Manual testing is for understanding, not just validation.**
26. **The gap between theory and practice is smaller in theory.**
27. **Believe types when they agree with your intuition.**
28. **Distrust types when they conflict with running code.**
29. **The proof is in the pudding, but the pudding must be typed.**

**The AI Relationship:**

30. **AI is your apprentice, not your master.**
31. **Good prompts produce verifiable code, not just working code.**
32. **When AI is confused, simplify your specification.**
33. **When you're confused, ask AI to write the specification.**
34. **The best AI conversations end with "I understand the proof."**
35. **Treat AI like a brilliant junior developer: guide firmly, verify thoroughly.**

**The Tool Philosophy:**

36. **Your development environment should adapt to your thoughts.**
37. **Magic commands are the beginning, not the end.**
38. **If you can imagine a plugin, you should build it.**
39. **Terminals are for composition, IDEs are for comprehension.**
40. **The ultimate vibe is when your tools read your mind.**

*Now go forth and vibe, but remember: the computer always wins in the end.*
