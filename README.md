# zen-of-vibe-coding
Vibe Coding: AI-driven development where unverified code is pseudocode. Use Haskell as your design bridge, Coq for architecture proofs, and SMT for code verification. Trust types, test manually, avoid dependencies. Your IDE becomes an AI terminal - extend it relentlessly. Build locally, verify rigorously.
