# The Zen of Vibe Coding

*Beautiful is better than ugly, but runnable is better than beautiful.*  
*Explicit is better than implicit, but verified is better than explicit.*  
*Simple is better than complex, but correct is better than simple.*  
*Complex is better than complicated, but proven is better than complex.*  

**The Core Principles:**

1. **Duplication is good. Dependency is disaster.**
2. **All unverified code is pseudocode.**
3. **If the documentation feels weird, the code must be wrong.**
4. **Trust the types, but verify the proofs.**
5. **Haskell is the bridge between Coq and Python - use it wisely.**
6. **Prove code with symbolic execution, prove design with Coq.**
7. **Tests are cheap, but manual verification is priceless.**
8. **A script becomes a project when AI cannot fix it greedily.**
9. **The internet is a distraction - code locally, think globally.**
10. **Your AI lives in a terminal, but your terminal should be everywhere.**
11. **Your AI should never change in one project and always act as a pure function with no side effects and random outputs.**
12. **Do not trust your AI service provider unless your are the provider itself.**
13. **A novel idea emerges good project written by AI which can not be losslessly compressed into idea with same length again with AI without that good idea.**
14. **Do not introduce novel idea in a script, Do not let your project do something trivial.**
